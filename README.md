# NBA Box Score scraper

This repository was motivated by the apparent lack of NBA Box Scores online.
It's entirely possible that I missed something and just re-invented the wheel
here, but perhaps it's useful to some!

I wanted to be able to scrape box scores all the way back to the merger of the
NBA with the ABA. This tool will hopefully eventually be able to do that.

To run, just do:

`python scrape_box_scores.py`

More information will follow. Note that this is still under development and I
haven't tested it.
